            <p>This is my first website!</p>
            <p>We are the only club that hosts community events for students who are Indonesian or affiliated with an Indonesian
            identity in the University of Southern California. We bring our members together through either cultural events,
            excursions or campaigns. We have a strong identity and we are always up to the challenge of being creative with the way
            we nurture community.</p>
